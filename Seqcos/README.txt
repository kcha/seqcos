############################################## Sequence Quality Control Studio (SeQCoS)# Version 1.0.0 (November 2011)#############################################SeQCoS is an open source software suite for performing quality control of massively parallel sequencing reads.SeQCoS is available at http://seqcos.codeplex.com under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (found here http://seqcos.codeplex.com/license).The user manual is available online: http://seqcos.codeplex.com/documentationAll bug reports and feedback are appreciated and should be reported on the Codeplex project website.################## INSTALLATION#################First, install any prerequisites, including .NET 4 Framework and Sho. NextRun SeqcosSetup-1.0.0.msi and follow the on screen instructions.*** Warning *** For 64-bit users or for those who installed Sho in a custom location, theconfiguration files SeqcosGui.exe.config and SeqcosUtil.exe.config need to beupdated so that the correct Sho bin directory is used. Otherwise, an error willoccur during SeQCoS execution.The easiest way is to execute the utility program ConfigUpdaterUtil.exe(included in installation) with Administrator privileges, which will update theSho paths of each config file according to the environment variable SHODIR. Alternatively, you can manually update thec config files. Sorry about this! A better solution is being investigated.################## UNINSTALL#################Simply uninstall from the Control Panel.
